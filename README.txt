I HAVE FOLLOWED THE GUIDELINES SPECIFIED FOR THIS
ASSIGNMENT, AND RAN TESTING ON THE HTML AND CSS FILES
TO AVOID HAVING ERRORS. I IMPLEMENTED A TABLE TO USE
FOR MY RESUME PAGE WHICH ORGANIZES THE DATA IN A MORE
CLEAR AND ORGANIZED MANNER.

I HAVE DISCUSSED THE PROJECT WITH KENNY SLABY AND A
FEW TAS.

I HAVE SPENT APPROXIMATELY 10 TO 12 HOURS ON THE 
ASSIGNMENT.
